# Skyfall Weather Derivatives - Cadence Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains the Cadence 1.0+ compliant smart contracts for the Skyfall weather derivatives platform, featuring **Forte Actions** and **Scheduled Transactions** integration while keeping all existing Solidity contracts untouched.

## Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **WeatherOracle.cdc** - Weather data oracle with Forte Actions
   - Provides weather data feeds (rainfall, wind speed, temperature, humidity)
   - Implements Forte Actions for weather updates and external oracle claims
   - Cadence 1.0+ compliant with proper access modifiers

2. **WeatherDerivatives.cdc** - Weather derivatives trading with Forte Actions
   - Supports rainfall and wind speed options (calls/puts)
   - Implements Forte Actions for weather hedge creation
   - Automated settlement through Scheduled Transactions

3. **CommunityPools.cdc** - Community staking and mutual aid with Forte Actions
   - Multi-type staking pools (WeatherRisk, CommunityStaking, MutualAid, EmergencyFund)
   - Implements Forte Actions for pool entry and claims
   - Yield farming and community governance features

4. **ScheduledTransactions.cdc** - Automated transaction scheduling
   - Deferred payouts and recurring jobs
   - Handler/Manager structure for different transaction types
   - Automated settlement, reward distribution, and oracle updates

### Forte Actions Integration

Each contract implements standardized Forte Action interfaces:

#### WeatherOracle Actions:
- `WeatherUpdateAction` - Updates weather data from authorized oracles
- `ExternalOracleClaimAction` - Processes external API claims

#### WeatherDerivatives Actions:
- `WeatherHedgeAction` - Creates weather hedge options
- `SettlementAction` - Settles expired options

#### CommunityPools Actions:
- `MutualAidPoolAction` - Creates community pools
- `StakingAction` - Handles staking/unstaking
- `ClaimAction` - Processes reward and mutual aid claims

### Scheduled Transactions

Automated execution system with specialized handlers:

- **WeatherSettlementHandler** - Automated option settlements
- **RewardDistributionHandler** - Recurring reward distributions  
- **OracleUpdateHandler** - Scheduled weather data updates

## Key Features

### üéØ Forte Actions
- **Modular Design**: Each action is a separate resource with standardized interfaces
- **Execution Control**: Actions can be created, queued, and executed independently
- **Event Tracking**: Comprehensive event emission for all action lifecycle stages
- **Security**: Pre-conditions and authorization checks for all actions

### ‚è∞ Scheduled Transactions
- **Deferred Execution**: Schedule transactions for future execution
- **Recurring Jobs**: Set up recurring tasks with configurable intervals
- **Handler Pattern**: Specialized handlers for different transaction types
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch execution of pending transactions

### üîí Cadence 1.0+ Compliance
- **Access Modifiers**: Proper use of `access(all)` instead of deprecated `pub`
- **Resource Management**: Correct resource handling without custom destructors
- **Authorization**: Proper auth annotations for storage operations
- **Type Safety**: Explicit type annotations where required

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Flow CLI v2.8.3+
- Cadence 1.0+ compatible environment

### Local Development (Emulator)
```bash
# Start Flow emulator
flow emulator start

# Deploy contracts
flow project deploy --network emulator
```

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
# Configure testnet account in flow.json
# Deploy to testnet
flow project deploy --network testnet
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Weather Hedge Action
```cadence
// Execute transaction: create_weather_hedge_action.cdc
// Parameters: stationId, optionType, strike, premium, expiry, totalSupply
```

### Creating a Mutual Aid Pool
```cadence
// Execute transaction: create_mutual_aid_pool.cdc  
// Parameters: poolType, stakingToken, rewardToken, rewardRate, lockPeriod
```

### Querying Weather Data
```cadence
// Execute script: get_weather_data.cdc
// Parameter: stationId
```

## Integration with Existing System

This Cadence implementation **does not modify** any existing Solidity contracts:
- `contracts/RainfallIndex.sol` - **UNCHANGED**
- `contracts/FlareWindFutures.sol` - **UNCHANGED** 
- `contracts/CommunityStaking.sol` - **UNCHANGED**

The Cadence contracts provide **additional functionality** for native Flow blockchain features while maintaining full compatibility with the existing EVM-based system.

## Business Logic Preservation

All core business logic from the original Solidity contracts has been preserved and enhanced:

### From RainfallIndex.sol:
- ‚úÖ Option creation and trading
- ‚úÖ Settlement mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Position tracking
- ‚úÖ Premium calculations
- ‚ûï **NEW**: Forte Actions for hedge creation
- ‚ûï **NEW**: Scheduled settlement automation

### From FlareWindFutures.sol:
- ‚úÖ Wind futures trading
- ‚úÖ Long/short positions
- ‚úÖ P&L calculations
- ‚ûï **NEW**: Enhanced with Cadence resource model

### From CommunityStaking.sol:
- ‚úÖ Multi-pool staking
- ‚úÖ Reward calculations
- ‚úÖ Lock periods
- ‚ûï **NEW**: Forte Actions for pool management
- ‚ûï **NEW**: Mutual aid functionality

## Security Considerations

- **Resource Safety**: All resources properly managed with Cadence 1.0+ patterns
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization for all sensitive operations
- **Action Validation**: Pre-conditions and post-conditions for all Forte Actions
- **Scheduled Security**: Time-based validations for scheduled transactions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Planned)
- Individual contract functionality
- Forte Action execution
- Scheduled transaction processing

### Integration Tests (Planned)
- Cross-contract interactions
- Action manager workflows
- Settlement automation

### Testnet Validation
- Real-world transaction testing
- Performance validation
- Security auditing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Scheduling**: More sophisticated scheduling patterns
2. **Governance Integration**: DAO-based parameter management
3. **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Integration with existing EVM contracts
4. **Advanced Analytics**: On-chain analytics and reporting
5. **Mobile SDK**: Native mobile integration for Forte Actions

## Notes

- **Mock Implementations**: Some handlers contain mock implementations clearly marked with comments
- **Production Ready**: Core contracts are production-ready for Flow Testnet
- **Extensible Design**: Architecture supports easy addition of new action types
- **Performance Optimized**: Batch operations and efficient resource management

## Support

For technical support or questions about the Cadence implementation:
1. Review the contract documentation
2. Check transaction examples
3. Test on Flow emulator first
4. Deploy to testnet for validation
