## **üéØ JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

### **Q: "Are these real blockchain transactions?"**
**A:** "The contracts are live on Flow testnet at 0xf2085ff3cef1d657. We use enhanced demo mode for reliable presentation, but the architecture supports real execution. You can verify our contracts on the blockchain explorer."

### **Q: "How does the AI agent work?"**
**A:** "It analyzes natural language queries and maps them to available Flow Actions. The agent can discover actions, compose workflows, and execute them automatically. It's like having a blockchain assistant that understands what you want to do."

### **Q: "What makes this different from other projects?"**
**A:** "We're the only team with live testnet contracts and AI integration. Our Flow Actions are FLIP-338 compliant and solve real-world problems. Farmers can get automated weather protection without understanding blockchain complexity."

### **Q: "Can you show the action chaining?"**
**A:** "Absolutely! Watch this: Weather update ‚Üí Derivative creation ‚Üí Settlement scheduling. Three separate actions that compose into a complete automated workflow. Each action has safety checks and can be reused in different combinations."

### **Q: "How does scheduled transactions work?"**
**A:** "Smart contracts can schedule future execution without external triggers. When weather conditions are met, payouts happen automatically. No keepers, no servers - pure onchain automation."
