Adding a small info tooltip for each underlying asset (e.g., rainfall, temperature, wind index) is an excellent UX enhancement. Placing a clickable or hoverable "i" icon (or similar) on the top right of each underlying’s section allows users to quickly access key details and context without cluttering the main interface.

Benefits
Clarity: Users can instantly understand what each underlying represents, how it’s measured, and why it matters for options or pools.

Transparency: Shows data provenance, update frequency, and settlement logic for each underlying.

Education: Helps new users learn about weather indexes, risk factors, and contract triggers.

Trust: Reinforces that the platform is data-driven and user-centric.

Suggested Tooltip Content
For each underlying, the tooltip could include:

Name and Description:
E.g., “Dallas, TX Rainfall Index — Total rainfall in millimeters measured over the last 24 hours by WeatherXM stations.”

Data Source:
E.g., “Data from WeatherXM, delivered on-chain via Chainlink Oracle.”

Update Frequency:
E.g., “Updated every hour/on demand.”

Settlement Logic:
E.g., “Options settle based on the final value at expiry. Payouts are triggered if rainfall exceeds the strike.”

Timestamp and Verification:
E.g., “Last update: 2 mins ago. Cryptographically verified.”

(Optional) Link to More Info:
“Learn more about how this index is calculated.”

Implementation Tips
Use a small, consistent icon (e.g., “i” or “?”) on the top right of each underlying’s card or section.

On click (or hover), display a compact modal or dropdown with the info above.

Make the tooltip accessible (keyboard and screen reader support).

Allow easy updates to tooltip content as new underlyings or data sources are added.
