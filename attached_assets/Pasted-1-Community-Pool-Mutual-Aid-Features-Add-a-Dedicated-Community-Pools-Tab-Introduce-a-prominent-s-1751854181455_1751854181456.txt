1. Community Pool & Mutual Aid Features
Add a Dedicated Community Pools Tab:
Introduce a prominent section for "Community Pools" where users can:

Create, join, and manage pools.

View pool stats: Total Value Locked (TVL), member count, next payout, payout history, and activity feed.

See member lists and governance proposals.

On-Chain Governance:
Allow pool members to propose and vote on changes (e.g., payout rules, eligibility). Display active proposals and voting results in the UI.

Eligibility Calculator:
Let users input their stake and estimate potential payouts for the next event.

2. Weather Data Source & Oracle Transparency
Clear Data Provenance:
Always display the weather data source (e.g., “WeatherXM via Chainlink Oracle”) in relevant UI sections.

Timestamps & Verification:
Show timestamps and, if available, cryptographic proof for each data update to support auditability.

Update Frequency & Settlement Logic:
Clarify in the UI or documentation:

How often weather data is updated (on-demand, hourly, daily).

How and when settlements are triggered (e.g., after expiry, or when a threshold is crossed).

3. Option Pricing & Greeks Explanation
Greeks Tooltips:
Add tooltips or info popups explaining each Greek (Delta, Theta, etc.) in the context of weather options, using simple language and weather-specific examples.

Pricing Model Disclosure:
Briefly describe the pricing methodology (e.g., “Monte Carlo simulation using historical rainfall data”) in the UI or documentation.

4. Settlement & Payout Logic Transparency
Payout History Tab:
Add a section showing all past payouts, including event date, trigger condition, recipients, and amounts.

Eligibility & Distribution Logic:
Clearly outline:

How and when settlements occur (manual trigger or automatic).

How payouts are distributed (equal split, proportional, needs-based).

Provide a visual eligibility indicator for each user.

5. User Onboarding & Documentation
Written Onboarding Guide:
Provide a clear, step-by-step written guide for new users covering:

Wallet connection

Trading options

Joining community pools

Understanding risk and settlement

Help/FAQ Section:
Add an in-app “Help” or “FAQ” section for quick reference on common questions and troubleshooting.

6. Highlight AI Features
AI Insights Visibility:
Make AI-driven analytics (e.g., Monte Carlo pricing, anomaly detection, index smoothing) more prominent in the UI.

Use badges or info icons with brief explanations of how AI is used for pricing, risk scoring, and data validation.

Transparency for AI Decisions:
When AI flags anomalies or suggests pricing, display a short rationale so users understand the basis for these insights.

7. Underlying Index Chart
Add a Rainfall Index Chart:
Display a line chart of the rainfall index over the past 30 days (or selectable periods). Place this chart near the options chain or in each underlying’s section.

Mark strike levels or payout thresholds for clarity.

Allow users to hover for exact values and see tooltips for significant events.

8. General UX & Accessibility
Responsive & Accessible Design:
Ensure all new UI components are mobile-friendly and accessible, with clear labels, adequate contrast, and keyboard navigation support.

Consistent Styling:
Maintain a cohesive, modern look throughout, matching the options chain and portfolio sections.
