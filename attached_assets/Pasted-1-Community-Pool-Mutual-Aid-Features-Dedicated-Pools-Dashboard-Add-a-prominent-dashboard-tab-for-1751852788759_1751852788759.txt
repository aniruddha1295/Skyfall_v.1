Timestamps & Proof:
Show timestamps and, if possible, cryptographic proof or signatures for each data update.

Update Frequency & Settlement Logic:
In the UI or documentation, explain:

How often weather data is updated (on-demand, hourly, daily)

How and when settlements are triggered (e.g., after expiry, or when a threshold is crossed).

3. Option Pricing & Greeks Explanation
Greeks Tooltips:
Add tooltips or info popups that explain each Greek (e.g., Delta, Theta) in the context of weather options, using simple language and weather-specific examples.

Pricing Model Disclosure:
Briefly describe the pricing methodology (e.g., “Monte Carlo simulation using historical rainfall data”) in the UI or documentation so users understand how premiums and payouts are determined.

4. Settlement & Payout Logic Transparency
Payout History Tab:
Add a section showing all past payouts, including:

Event date

Trigger condition (e.g., rainfall > 25mm)

Recipients and amounts

Eligibility & Distribution Logic:
Clearly outline:

How and when settlements occur (manual trigger or automatic)
