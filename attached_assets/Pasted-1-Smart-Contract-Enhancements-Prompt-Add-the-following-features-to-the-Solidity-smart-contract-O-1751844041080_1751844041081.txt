1. Smart Contract Enhancements
Prompt:
Add the following features to the Solidity smart contract:

Option Lifecycle Management:

Support for option creation, purchase, exercise, and expiration.

Include both call and put options for rainfall indexes.

Allow for multiple strikes and expiration dates.

Automated Settlement:

Integrate on-chain triggers for automatic settlement and payout based on WeatherXM rainfall data.

Support for partial and full settlements if the contract allows.

Event Emission:

Emit detailed events for all key actions (creation, purchase, exercise, expiration, settlement) to support real-time UI updates.

Fee and Premium Logic:

Implement platform fees and dynamic premium calculation based on market demand or AI-driven risk scoring.

Access Control:

Add admin controls for contract upgrades, emergency stops, and parameter adjustments.

2. WeatherXM Oracle/Data Integration
Prompt:
Integrate WeatherXM’s on-chain oracle (or, if not public, a secure backend relay):

On-Chain Data Bridge:

Ensure the smart contract can receive and verify rainfall data directly from WeatherXM’s oracle or a trusted relay service.

Set up scheduled or event-driven updates for rainfall index values.

Data Integrity:

Add cryptographic verification (proofs, signatures) if supported by WeatherXM’s oracle.

Include fallback/manual update mechanisms for demo or testing.

3. Advanced Option Pricing & Greeks
Prompt:
Implement advanced pricing and analytics:

Options Pricing Module:

Use historical rainfall data and a mean-reverting (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) or Monte Carlo simulation model for fair value calculation.

Display expected value, risk, and premium for each contract.

Greeks Calculation:

Calculate and display Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta for each option contract, using the chosen pricing model.

Show these metrics in the frontend for transparency and advanced users.

4. Frontend Features (React.js, Robinhood-Style UI)
Prompt:
Upgrade the frontend with the following:

Options Chain Visualization:

Display a full options chain with strikes, expiries, premiums, Greeks, and real-time rainfall index.

User Portfolio Dashboard:

Show all user positions, open contracts, settlement status, and historical trades.

Interactive Trade Modals:

Simple, step-by-step buy/sell flows with clear confirmation and error handling.

Live Data & Notifications:

Real-time updates for rainfall index, contract status, and payouts.

Push notifications for option expiry, settlement, or major weather events.

Accessibility & Responsiveness:

Ensure the UI is mobile-friendly and accessible.

5. Liquidity & Community Pool Integration
Prompt:
Add support for liquidity providers and mutual aid pools:

AMM Integration:

Allow users to provide liquidity to option pools and earn trading fees.

Show pool stats (liquidity, utilization, fee earnings).

Community Pools:

Enable creation and management of mutual aid pools for collective risk sharing.

Add governance features (voting, proposals) for pool members.

6. Security, Testing, and Documentation
Prompt:
Ensure best practices and usability:

Comprehensive Testing:

Unit and integration tests for all smart contract functions.

Test edge cases for data updates, settlements, and payouts.

Security Features:

Add rate limiting, input validation, and emergency stop mechanisms.

Documentation:

Update README and in-app guides to explain all features, flows, and contract logic in English.

7. Optional: AI/ML Microservice
Prompt:
If not already present, add a Python FastAPI microservice to:

Process WeatherXM rainfall data for anomaly detection or advanced index smoothing.

Provide endpoints for the frontend and smart contract to fetch processed analytics.
