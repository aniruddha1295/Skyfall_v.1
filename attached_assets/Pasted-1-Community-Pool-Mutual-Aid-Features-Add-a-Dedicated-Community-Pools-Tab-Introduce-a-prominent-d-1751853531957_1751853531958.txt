1. Community Pool & Mutual Aid Features
Add a Dedicated Community Pools Tab:
Introduce a prominent dashboard section for “Community Pools” where users can create, join, and manage mutual aid pools. This should include:

Pool creation/join flows with customizable parameters (payout logic, eligibility).

Real-time pool stats: Total Value Locked (TVL), member count, next payout, and payout history.

Member list and recent activity feed (new members, payouts, governance proposals).

On-chain governance (proposals, voting) for pool rules and payouts.

2. Weather Data Source & Oracle Transparency
Display Data Provenance:
Clearly show the weather data source (e.g., “WeatherXM via Chainlink Oracle”) in all relevant UI sections.

Show Timestamps & Proof:
Add timestamps and, if possible, cryptographic proofs or signatures for each data update to support auditability.

Explain Update Frequency & Settlement Logic:
In the UI or documentation, clarify how often weather data is updated (on-demand, hourly, daily) and how/when settlements are triggered (e.g., after expiry, or when a threshold is crossed).

3. Option Pricing & Greeks Explanation
Greeks Tooltips:
Add tooltips or info popups that explain each Greek (Delta, Theta, etc.) in the context of weather options, using plain language and weather-specific examples.

Pricing Model Disclosure:
Briefly describe the pricing methodology (e.g., “Monte Carlo simulation using historical rainfall data”) in the UI or documentation so users understand how premiums and payouts are determined.

4. Settlement & Payout Logic Transparency
Payout History Tab:
Add a section showing all past payouts, including event date, trigger condition (e.g., rainfall > 25mm), recipients, and amounts.

Eligibility & Distribution Logic:
Clearly outline how and when settlements occur (manual trigger or automatic), how payouts are distributed (equal split, proportional, needs-based), and provide a visual eligibility indicator for each user.

Eligibility Calculator:
Let users input their stake to estimate potential payouts for the next event.

5. User Onboarding & Documentation
Written Onboarding Guide:
Provide a clear, step-by-step written guide for new users covering wallet connection, trading options, joining community pools, and understanding risk and settlement.

Help/FAQ Section:
Add an in-app “Help” or “FAQ” section for quick reference on common questions and troubleshooting.

6. Highlight AI Features
AI Insights Visibility:
Make AI-driven analytics (e.g., Monte Carlo pricing, anomaly detection, index smoothing) more prominent in the UI.

Use badges or info icons with brief explanations of how AI is used for pricing, risk scoring, and data validation.

Transparency for AI Decisions:
When AI flags anomalies or suggests pricing, display a short rationale or summary so users understand the basis for these insights.

7. General UX & Accessibility
Responsive & Accessible Design:
Ensure all new UI components are mobile-friendly and accessible, with clear labels, adequate contrast, and keyboard navigation support.

Consistent Styling:
Maintain a cohesive, modern look throughout, matching the options chain and portfolio sections.
