1. Community Pool / Mutual Aid Component
Fully Interactive:
Users can create, join, and manage pools directly from the UI.

On-Chain Governance:
Proposals and voting are visible and actionable in the dashboard.

Dashboard Stats:
Real-time pool stats (TVL, member list, recent payouts) are shown with detailed breakdowns.

Notifications/Activity Feeds:
Users receive updates for pool events, e.g., new members, triggered payouts.

2. Weather Data Source and Oracle Integration
Data Sources:
Use both WeatherXM’s oracle and Chainlink for redundancy and trust.

Backend Relay:
The backend fetches, formats, and relays weather data on-chain (rather than the contract pulling directly).

Update Frequency:
Rainfall data is updated on-chain on demand (when needed for settlement or user action).

Data Provenance:
UI displays proof of source, timestamp, and other contextual details for auditing and transparency.

3. Option Pricing and Greeks
Live Calculation:
Option pricing and Greeks are calculated live in the frontend or backend (Python or JS).

Pricing Model:
Use Monte Carlo simulation for weather option pricing.

UI Tooltips:
Tooltips/info popups explain each Greek and its weather-specific meaning.

Subset for MVP:
Only display a subset of Greeks (e.g., Delta and Theta) for MVP—expand later as needed.

4. Settlement and Payout Logic
Manual Trigger/Approval:
Settlement and payouts can be manually triggered/approved for MVP (automate later).

Customizable Payout Logic:
Community pools support equal split, needs-based, or proportional payouts.

Visibility:
Payout events and eligibility criteria are highly visible in the UI.
Example:

Dedicated “Payout History” tab showing event, date, recipients, and amount.

Eligibility calculator where users can input their stake and see potential payout.

Automatic Payouts:
Once triggered, payouts are pushed automatically to eligible wallets (no user claim required).

5. User Onboarding and Documentation
Written Guide:
A clear, written guide in the documentation is sufficient for onboarding.

Walkthroughs in Docs:
No need for interactive UI walkthroughs at this stage.

Risk Disclosures:
No special compliance/risk notices required for MVP.

Documentation Hosting:
No need to host docs within the DApp—external resources are fine for now.

Example: Payout Visibility Section
Payout History Tab Example:

Event	Date	Pool Name	Recipients	Amount	Trigger
Flood Payout	2025-07-03	Dallas Pool	12 members	$1,200	Rainfall > 60mm
Drought Relief	2025-06-20	Texas Agri	8 members	$800	Rainfall < 10mm
Eligibility Calculator Example:

User enters their pool contribution and sees projected payout for the next event.

UI displays: “With your stake of $100, you would receive $120 if the next payout is triggered.”

Summary Table: Your Feature Decisions
Feature Area	Your Choice/Preference
Community Pool UI	Fully interactive, with on-chain governance and detailed stats
Weather Data Integration	WeatherXM + Chainlink, backend relays on-chain, on-demand updates, provenance in UI
Option Pricing/Greeks	Live calculation (Python/JS), Monte Carlo, tooltips, subset of Greeks for MVP
Settlement/Payouts	Manual trigger for MVP, customizable logic, payouts pushed automatically, high visibility
Onboarding/Docs	Written guide only, no in-app walkthrough, no risk notices, external docs acceptable
