1. Community Pool Visibility and Functionality
Add a dedicated dashboard tab for community/mutual aid pools.

Enable users to create, join, and manage pools directly from the UI.

Implement on-chain governance features (proposals, voting) accessible within the dashboard.

Display detailed pool statistics: Total Value Locked (TVL), member lists, payout history, and eligibility criteria.

Add notifications and activity feeds for pool events (e.g., new members, payouts, governance actions).

2. Weather Data Source and Oracle Integration
Clearly display the provenance of weather data in the UI, e.g., “Data Source: WeatherXM, delivered on-chain via [oracle name]”.

Show timestamps and cryptographic proof or signatures of data delivery for auditing and transparency.

In the UI or documentation, explain how often weather data updates occur and how settlements are triggered (manual or automatic).

3. Option Pricing and Greeks Explanation
Add tooltips or info popups explaining the meaning and calculation of Greeks (e.g., Delta, Theta) specifically for weather derivatives.

Briefly describe the option pricing model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation) in the UI or documentation so users understand how premiums and payouts are determined.

4. Settlement and Payout Logic Transparency
Add a dedicated “Payout History” tab or section showing all past payout events, including date, amount, recipient, and triggering condition.

Implement an “Eligibility Calculator” where users input their stake or pool contribution to estimate their potential payout.

Clearly outline the settlement process in the UI or documentation, specifying whether settlements are manual or automatic and how payouts are distributed.

5. User Onboarding and Documentation
Provide a clear, written onboarding guide covering wallet connection, trading, pool participation, and risk disclosures.

Add a “Help” or “FAQ” section within the app for easy reference.

6. Highlight AI Features
If AI is used for index smoothing, anomaly detection, or option pricing, make these features visible in the UI.

Provide brief explanations or tooltips about how AI contributes to pricing, risk assessment, or data integrity.
